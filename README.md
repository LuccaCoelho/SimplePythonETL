# Simple Python ETL

## introduction

This is an extremely simple Python ETL pipeline that extracts, tranforms, and load data from CSV, JSON, and XML files. Used different libraries to extract the data, transform the data and create logs. I am learning ETL processes and enjoy this very much.

## Libraries

Pandas: Used to extracted the data from 3 different types of files (CSV, JSON, XML), and load data into data frames.
Glob: It was used to extracted the data alongside Pandas.
XML ElementTree: Was used to extract data from XML files alongside Pandas.
Datetime: Used to created logs.
